BUGS:
    - no scores on the LogThinking, only totals
    FIXED- checked cell remains in color after AI moves
    FIXED- Checking visual happens when same piece color is hit
    - clicking info modal is the same as back
    - Minimize damage AI is dumb. How can a -9 move be the best. Look at the query
    - Promotion bug when no captures can be promoted
    - Castling is not complete, check wiki, read requirements
        the line of sight is not working. White king right side jumping over bishop

TODO:
    DONE- Reset captures when new game
    - Do the totalscore
    - Do some unittests on the FEN string of BoardState
	- Feels like there is another way to count score
	    current way: we make a move, and then take the counter move score for any piece and add to that move
	    this will end with a net score for the initial move

IMPROVEMENTS:
    INFRASTRUCTURE
    PRACTISES
        - Promoting is not limited to earlier captures (can't add king or another pawn)
    GAMEPLAY
        - castling
            The king is not being checked for previous movement
            - check also that the rook new pos is free
        - special moves
            pawn: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawn_(chess)#:~:text=Normally%20a%20pawn%20moves%20by,or%20foe%2C%20blocks%20its%20advance.
                    - en passant
        
	VISUALS
	    - Make it fit (css)
	        laptops
	        tablets
	        phones
	    - fade old captures slightly
	    - As we are counting scores with the AI, lets add a winning meter to the right also telling the worth
	        of the captures (delta)
	    - We need some captured pieces to the right, so that we can see if something was captured
	    - show border around last position moved to
		- add arrow/line showing move from and to
		
	AI
	    - Even though chess gives good points, we should also check moves
	    - What is the AI thinking here? [k/p1Rp3Q/B3NK/8/8/8/2P/8 b]
	    - Check defensive moves, right now I think we only check captures, but we should also count
	        scores as negative if we don't move a piece
	        Some moves are randomized when no good captures, but there should be scores on 1 depth also
	        so that we can see the losing point.
		- When more pieces than opponent, try to move pieces closer to king (without being captured)
		- Go for promotions
		    check capture piece and add that as a move with points
